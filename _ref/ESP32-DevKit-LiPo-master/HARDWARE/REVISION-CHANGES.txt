Hardware revsion A1
=========
Initial release

Major changes in hardware revision B
========
1. R5(NA/R0603) deleted to free up space on the board;
2. BAT1 connector's package changed from DW02R to DW02S;
3. Added: R2, R5, C9, BAT_PWR_E1 and BAT_SENS_E1 to allow for battery measurement;
4. U5's symbol and package changed from ESP-WROOM-32 to the ESP32-WROVER(_PCB,_IPEX,-xB)_and_ESP-WROOM-32-Universal. This allows to place either Wroom or Wrover ESP32 module;
5. L1's value changed from 2.2uH/1.5A/DCR<0.1R/CD32 to 2.2uH/1.5A/DCR=72mR/20%/3.00x3.00x1.50mm/CD32(NR3015T2R2M);
6. The PWRLED1(LED/RED/0603) and R2(2.2k/R0603) deleted to save place on the board. The CHARGING1 LED will be used for charging and power good indicator!;
8. Added: R15, R16, and PWR_SENS_E1 to allow external power ON/OFF detection;
9. U2(CH340) corrected power supply - from 3.3V to only +5V_USB. For 3.3/5V(Tx/Rx) volatage translators were used: D4 and  D4(1N5819S4/SOD123), R6 and R7. R6 and R7 were changed from 220R/R0603 to 10k/0603. Thus, CH340 will not be powered when attached to a battery - avoiding additional battery discharge!;
10. U4(BAT54C(SOT23-3)) renamed to D3;
11. R1(10k/0603) changed to 10k/0402;
12. D1 and D2 changed from 1N5822/SS34/SMA to 1N5819S4/SOD123;
13. R11 changed from 4.99k/1%/R0603 to 220k/R0402, and R12 was changed from 1.1k/1%/R0603 to 49.9k/1%/R0402 to save power consumption when on battery;
14. R14(NA/R0603) deleted to free place on the PCB;
15. R13 changed from 1k/R0603 to 10k/R0402;
16. R8 and R9 changed from 1k/R0603 to 2.2k/0402;
17. All 0805 capacitors exchanged with 0603, all 0603 resistors with 0402 and several 0603 caps changed to 0402. The BOM is completely different!
18. R2 and R5 changed from 100k/R0402 to 470k/R0402 to decrease the battery discharging;
19. R13 changed from 10k/R0402 to 470k/R0402 to decrease the battery discharging;
20. R15 changed from 49.9k/1%/R0402 to 220k/R0402 and R16 changed from 100k/R0402 to 470k/R0402;
21. The 3D models were assignend in the PCB.

Major changes in hardware revision C
========
1. Text labels: ESP-WROOM-32 and ESP32-WROVER moved from F.Silk layer to the Dwgs.User to avoid confusion;
2. Added C8(1uF/10V/10%/X5R/C0603) and changed R13 470k/R0402 to 10k/R0402 - this improves start up behavior;
